# Personas

Each of the three calls required Viking to play a specific role. Each caller the system impersonated had to behave accordingly. This was done by switching _personas_.

Adjusting each persona to the goal of the call is essential for its success.

**Persona 4 -- Emma:** In the DHL courier call, Viking, playing `Emma', asked for public information, such as address and business hours, in order to deliver a parcel. `Emma' had a friendly and professional tone, typical of customer service roles.
